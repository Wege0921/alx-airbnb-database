-- 1. INNER JOIN: Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings
SELECT 
    bookings.id AS booking_id,

-- 2. LEFT JOIN: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews
SELECT

-- 3. FULL OUTER JOIN: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user
-- Note: Use UNION of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to simulate FULL OUTER JOIN if using MySQL
SELECT
